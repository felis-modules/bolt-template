# Getting Started with bolt-template!

Getting started with bolt template

this project enables you to get started faster

## Install

First, you should install [`python 3`](https://www.python.org/) and [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

`poetry` can load the pip dependencies easily like `npm` and make the virtual environment so that would not crash with your environment.

After that, you can just build your project with [`beet`](https://github.com/mcbeet/beet)!

First, install poetry project dependencies.

```cmd
poetry install
```

That's it! If you want to link your output files to your singleplayer world, then use `beet link`.

```cmd
beet link "your world folder name"
```

## Import your existing datapacks / resourcepacks.

You can just put your datapack into src / resource folder and link it to your beet project.

## Watch

you can also use watch features with `beet`, so that you can easily check your works whenever you changes your files.

```
beet watch
```
